# Module 2
Basic Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Vocabulary and hands on unit testing with C# and Visual Studio 2019
## Overview
In this lesson, you will modify the predefined console app created at the start of a new project.  Your goal is to make your own class library with a custom namespace and interface.  that you can use to interact with the console.  You will need to create your own classes, namespaces, and interfaces.  In this module, you may not know what everything does or how it works and that is OK.  However, you do need to be able to create a unit test, namespace, interface, class, and methods.   As we go on in the course we will go into more detail about data types and what is going on in the program.
### Prerequisites 
1. Windows 10 Pro/Education/Enterprise wit Visual Studio 2019 Community - [Click Here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
2. Git Installed - [Click Here](https://git-scm.com/)
3. Docker Desktop Installed and a Docker Hub Account- [Click Here](https://www.docker.com/)
4. Github Account Created - [Click Here](http://www.github.com)
### Before completing the module you should be able to:
1.  Create a console app program
2.  Create a namespace titled with your githubID i.e. kaw393939 and then nest the additional namespaces for your libraries inside this
3.  Create a consoleInstance class to implement your IConsole interface
4.  Define a "Constructor" and add it to your class.
5.  Create a test project and test your library
6.  Modify the stating point of the program to run the program through your console class library.
7.  You should be able to compare and explain namespaces, interfaces, and classes
8.  You should be able to explain why unit testing is important.
9.  You should be able to publish your work to GitHub.
### General Steps to Setup Project in Video
1. Create a C# console app project with VS Studio 2019
2. Analyze the Code
3. Run the the Hello world project in debug mode
4. Begin refactoring your code to make it possible to write unit tests for your library
5. Add a new project to your solution which is a C# dot net core class file
6. Create a class file and interface and place them in their respective folders.
7. Write the interface and class file to have a contructor and a method to print to the command line.
8. Add a C# unit test project by right clicking on the solution.  Test for the object creation and the display method.
9. Publish your project as a .net core 3.0 windows program and run it.
## Module Assignment
Your assignment is to complete the calculator tutorial and refactor it to implement unit testing, namespaces, interfaces, classes, and static methods.  Your final program should demonstrate your understanding of the Don't repeat yourself rule.

## Testing Requirements:
1.  You must have unit tests for all the functions you create and they must all pass.   
2.  Test that you can publish the program and run on your own computer
## Submission
1. Submit a link to your project on Github to the course LMS
2. Add a PowerPoint or Google Slides* Presentation of your program running unit tests and running from the command line.
3. Add a slide with any questions you have or comments about the project.  
4. Add a readme.md file in the root of your repository that contains your name and a link to the PowerPoint
